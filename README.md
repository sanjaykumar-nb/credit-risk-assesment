Credit Risk Assessment Using Alternative Data
Introduction
This repository contains the solution for credit risk assessment using alternative data, developed as part of a hackathon project. The objective is to build a machine learning pipeline that combines traditional financial data (e.g., income, credit history) with alternative data sources (e.g., utility payments, social media behavior) to predict creditworthiness.

Our approach includes analyzing the dataset, preprocessing it, and implementing machine learning models to provide accurate, explainable predictions for lenders.

Problem Statement
Many individuals lack sufficient credit history to access traditional lending products, despite having steady income or positive financial behavior.
This project aims to:

Leverage alternative data (social media, utility payments, etc.) alongside traditional credit information.
Build machine learning models for real-time credit risk assessment.
Provide transparent, explainable credit risk scores for lenders.
Workflow
1. Dataset Analysis
Inspect the dataset for structure, completeness, and key features.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions and correlations.
2. Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values: Fill missing data using forward-fill or other imputation methods.
Normalization and Scaling: Standardize numerical features for model performance.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert text-based features to numerical representations using techniques like label encoding and one-hot encoding.
3. Feature Engineering
Create derived features such as debt-to-income ratio, on-time payment history, and social media sentiment scores.
Remove redundant or irrelevant features.
4. Correlation Analysis
Use a correlation matrix and feature importance scores to identify relationships between variables.
Address multicollinearity by dropping highly correlated features.
5. Model Training
Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing).
Train machine learning models, including:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
Neural Networks (for advanced feature representation)
6. Model Evaluation
Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score.
Use explainability tools like SHAP and LIME to interpret model predictions.
